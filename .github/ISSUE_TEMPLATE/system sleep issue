Hi! I would like to provide feedback on a system sleep issue, and I am not sure if this is an isolated case of mine. My device model is a 2016 13 inch Intel chip. I have been using this software for a long time to keep it updated to the latest macOS. But there is a problem that has been bothering me all along, which is that when the box cover is not connected to a power source, after a certain period of time (I am not sure how long), the operating system cannot remain in sleep mode. Instead, there is a startup sound and the password needs to be re entered to power on. Can you pay attention to this issue? Thank you!
